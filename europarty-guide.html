<h4>what is this website and how to use it</h4>
<p>
	this very simple and bare-bones e-thing aims to serve as a resource for those seeking to better understand the european parliament in order to make an informed vote as the June 9, 2024 eu election draws closer;
</p>
<p>
	it strives to be a smol stepping stone within the wider, necessary, and hopefully collective effort to dispell the fog of confusion, mis- and underrepresentation that shrouds the actions, aims, priorities and means of what the european union does, why, when, how, and for who/what (its politics);</p>
<p>
	despite being a website, it will try really hard to behave as a tree, with its main info-trunk giving way to multiple branches, of various lengths and widths, which will offer up other elements (the leaves, some fruit?), such as relevant contextual information or concrete examples about a given subject, person, party, or event;
</p>
<p>
	this arborescent structure aims to let visitors navigate (climb) the tree in a free-flowing, decentralized way, by offering, in as many instances as possible, elements that explain, clarify, contextualise, exemplify or expand on the information at hand;
</p>
<p>
	the underlying intention of choosing this structure is dual: first, to convey information in the most concrete, comprehensive and updated way possible, in opposition to the mainstreamed, mostly biased, and very often abstract, ineffective (for most of us), lingo-heavy and mind-boggingly-outdated ways in which politics and policy issues are talked about in mass media discourseâ€” wich largely leads to mass confusion, frustration, distrust and ultimately, disengagement from the public;
</p>
<p>
	second, to act as a point of departure, linking the visitor to any already-existing works, writings, studies, videos, commentaries, documentaries, or other sources of information already out there in the www that could enrich their knowledge and allow them to go on an informative, enraging, and hopefully engaging deep dive of the politics that, until things change, will continue to define, condition and guide how lives can be lived in this world.
</p>
<p>
	the third, invisible reason is that it just makes it much easier to build (and build on).

<h2>a note on translation</h2>
	this ðŸŒ³ has been built with simple language in order to make it easily translatable browsers offering in-browser translation. the translation function is mostly is only activated when a website is displayed in a languaged not commonly used/not recognized as your default. (so if you browse in english but want to show your german granny the website, here's how for the two browsers i know.)
</p>
	<strong>how to translate:</strong><br/>
	<ul>
	<li><b>on chrome:</b> right click>tiny menu appears> click on 'translate to X'</li>
	<li><b>on firefox:</b> the translation function is on the url bar or in the application menu (the â˜° hamburger icon)</li>
	<li><b>others???:</b></li> i guess a search of the www can help you stop using safari ðŸ˜Š
</ul>
